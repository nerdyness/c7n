      Mark any unattached EBS volumes for deletion in 30 days.
      Volumes set to not delete on instance termination do have
      valid use cases as data drives, but 99% of the time they
      appear to be just garbage creation.
    filters:
      - Attachments: []
      - "tag:maid_status": absent
    actions:
      - type: mark-for-op
        op: delete
        days: 30
